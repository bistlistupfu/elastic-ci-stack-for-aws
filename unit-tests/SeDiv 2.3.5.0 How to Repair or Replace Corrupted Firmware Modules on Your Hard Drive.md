- Drive inaccessible or extremely slow
- Drive overheating or smoking

If you encounter any of these symptoms, you should stop using the drive immediately and avoid any DIY attempts to fix it, as they may cause more damage and data loss. Instead, you should contact a reputable data recovery company that has the expertise and equipment to handle such cases.
 
Another thing to keep in mind is that SeDiv 2.3.5.0 is not a substitute for regular backups. Even if you have a good hard drive repair tool, you should always backup your important data to another location, such as an external hard drive, a cloud service, or a NAS device. This way, you can avoid losing your data in case of a hard drive failure or other disasters.
 
To summarize, SeDiv 2.3.5.0 is a powerful tool for hard drive repair that can help you fix many logical errors and firmware issues on your hard drive. However, it cannot fix physical damage or severe corruption that requires hardware intervention or professional assistance. Therefore, you should always backup your data and use SeDiv 2.3.5.0 with caution and care.
