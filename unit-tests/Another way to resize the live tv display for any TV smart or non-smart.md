If you are using a smart TV or a streaming device like Chromecast or Firestick, you may want to adjust the screen size and resolution of your live TV display to fit your preferences and TV capabilities. While most devices have their own settings menus that allow you to change these options, there is another way to resize the live TV display using your PC.
 
By connecting your PC to your TV via an HDMI cable, you can use your PC's display settings to customize the screen size and resolution of your live TV display. This can be useful if you want to use your PC as a media center or if you want to have more control over the display quality. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Connect your PC to your TV using an HDMI cable. Make sure both devices are turned on and set to the correct HDMI input.
2. On your PC, right-click on an empty space on your desktop and select "Display settings".
3. You should see two displays labeled "1" and "2". Display 1 is your PC monitor and display 2 is your TV. Click on display 2 to select it.
4. Under "Scale and layout", you can adjust the size of text, apps, and other items on your TV screen. You can also change the resolution and orientation of your TV display.
5. Under "Multiple displays", you can choose how you want to use your PC and TV displays. You can extend your desktop across both screens, duplicate your desktop on both screens, or show only on one screen.
6. Click "Apply" to save your changes and check how they look on your TV screen. You can also use the "Detect" and "Identify" buttons to troubleshoot any issues with your displays.

By using this method, you can resize the live TV display according to your needs and preferences. You can also switch back to the device's settings menu if you want to change other options like sound, color, or game mode[^1^] [^2^].
